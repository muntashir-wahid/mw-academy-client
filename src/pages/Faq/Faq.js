        What does an entry-level cybersecurity analyst do on a day-to-day basis?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Your daily tasks in an entry-level role will depend on the company
        you’re working for. Generally, day-to-day tasks might include:
        Monitoring a SIEM tool for anomalies Responding to alerts and escalating
        where appropriate Checking for proper firewall configuration Basic
        penetration testing Preparing security incident reports Researching new
        threats and attack methods Automating repetitive security tasks

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        What are the work hours in cybersecurity jobs?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Most cybersecurity analysts work full time, but they don’t always work
        typical 9-to-5 hours. Since cyber attacks can happen at any time, come
        organizations and security companies keep security analysts on-call
        outside of typical business hours. If you’re looking for a job with the
        flexibility to work evenings or weekend hours, cybersecurity could be a
        good fit.

        Is cybersecurity analytics hard?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Cybersecurity involves several technical skills, and the fast-paced work
        environment can be challenging. Having said that, it’s completely
        possible to gain the required knowledge and learn the right skills with
        some time and dedication. Set aside a little time for your cybersecurity
        learning each day, and consider setting up your own virtual environment
        to practice those skills.
